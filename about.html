                    <b>Hohenzollern Castle</b> is the ancestral seat of the imperial <i>House of Hohenzollern</i>. 
                    The third of three hilltop castles built on the site, it is located atop <i>Mount Hohenzollern</i>,
                    above and south of Hechingen, on the edge of the Swabian Jura of central Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

                    The Zeppelin circled slowly over this scene twice while the Prince surveyed it from the swinging gallery; 
                    it then rose towards the centre of the crescent and transferred the Prince and his suite, Kurt included, 
                    to the <b>Hohenzollern</b>, which had been chosen as the flagship during the impending battle.

                    He started off with a bright air of knowing his way and turned a corner or so, and was only beginning to 
                    suspect that he did not know where he was going when his attention was recalled to the sky by the report 
                    of a gun from the <b>Hohenzollern</b> and celestial cheering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only one little knot of four Germans and perhaps a dozen Asiatics remained fighting about the <b>Hohenzollern</b> 
                    and the Prince as he circled in a last attempt to save Niagara.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two of the Germans swooped and rose again, but the <b>Hohenzollern</b> had suffered too much for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It seemed for a time that the <b>Hohenzollern</b> must needs break her back upon the Parting of the Waters, 
                    and then for a time her propeller flopped and frothed in the river and thrust the mass of buckling, 
                    crumpled wreckage towards the American shore.
